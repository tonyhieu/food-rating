# Chow Checker

### LAHacks 2023 Project by Anthony Vo, Brian Kim, Nicholas Xue, and Mateus Behrend

## Inspiration
We wanted to make a more convenient way to check whether the food that a dining hall was serving was good

## What it does
Our site allows students to post comments and ratings for each of their school's dining halls so that others can compare them

## How we built it
We used React for the frontend user interface and Firebase for the backend database and API

## Challenges we ran into
Firebase was new to all of us, so we had to learn how to set up and structure the database, then figure out how to deploy the API to send json data to the webpage

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We created a working API and implemented a backend database with firebase. We also created a platform that allows for user input and updates the database and webpage in real time

## What we learned
We learned how to use Postman to send requests to the API

## What's next for Chow Checker
