# Chow Checker

### LAHacks 2023 Project by Anthony Vo, Brian Kim, Nicholas Xue, and Mateus Behrend

## Inspiration
We wanted to make a more convenient way to check whether the food that a dining hall was serving was good

## What it does
Our site allows students to post comments and ratings for each of their school's dining halls so that others can compare them

## How we built it
We used React for the frontend user interface and Firebase for the backend database and API

## Challenges we ran into
Firebase was new to all of us, so we had to learn how to set up and structure the database, then figure out how to deploy the API to send json data to the webpage

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
TODO

## What we learned
We learned how to use Postman to send requests to the API. We also learned the basics of Google Firebase and used endpoints from the frontend to call the API in order to make the post and get requests that were necessary for the project.

## What's next for Chow Checker
We are hoping to add many more universities to Chow Checker so that we can allow as many college students as possible to use this website to help them make informed decisions on which dining halls to go to for good food. Additionally, we would want to implement potential ratings for individual foods, rather than just an overall rating of a specific restaurant. Furthermore, we were planning on clearing data everyday so that ratings would be accurate for each day so that people would know when a specific restaurant had good food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner of everyday.
